These notes are intended to help developers understand the repository structure and code.

This is a work in progress.

# Background concepts

* Object Orientated programming
* Model-View-Controller
* OOUI and OOjs
   * OOUI windows, particularly OO.ui.ProgressDialog
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+), including arrow functions and classes
* NodeJS

# Repository structure
This repository basically consists of three parts:
* Loader - The entry point for the gadget that determines whether the core code loads
* Core - The main application code
* Repo-specific code and files - Scripts/code that assist in developing (including testing, building, and deploying)
